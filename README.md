# AyojanPro

A local event-service booking platform connecting **clients** who organize events with **verified professionals** who perform event services on-site (photography, videography, decoration, makeup, sound, etc.).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js + TypeScript |
| Framework | Express.js |
| ORM | Prisma 7 (multi-file schema) |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Auth | JWT + Google OAuth 2.0 |
| Payments | bKash |
| Media | Cloudinary |
| Email | Nodemailer |
| Cache / Rate Limit | Redis (optional) |

---

## Architecture

```
Routes → Middleware → Controller → Service → Prisma → PostgreSQL
```

- **Routes** — define endpoints and attach middleware
- **Middleware** — auth, RBAC, validation, rate limiting, file handling
- **Controllers** — thin; extract request data, call service, return response
- **Services** — all business logic, transactions, scheduling checks, payment verification
- **Prisma** — database access layer

---

## Roles

| Role | How the account is created |
|---|---|
| `CLIENT` | Self-register (credentials or Google OAuth) with email verification |
| `PROFESSIONAL` | Applies directly by creating a `User` + `Professional` profile (`status = PENDING`) → Admin flips status to `APPROVED`/`REJECTED` |
| `ADMIN` | Platform-seeded; not publicly registrable |

> There is no separate application table — the `Professional` model **is** the application. It carries `status`, `resume`, `rejectionReason`, `reviewedById`, `reviewedAt` alongside the normal profile fields. A `PENDING`/`REJECTED` professional is blocked from any professional-only action even though the row already exists.

---

## Core Workflow

```
Client creates Event
  └─ Adds Service Requirements (each with own budget + time range)
       └─ Qualified Professionals submit Proposals for the requirements they match
            └─ Client accepts a Proposal → Contract created (PENDING)
                 └─ Client pays 30% → Contract CONFIRMED
                      └─ Service performed on-site → Contract IN_PROGRESS
                           └─ Professional marks service DELIVERED (± Deliverable links)
                                └─ Client pays 70% → Contract COMPLETED
                                     └─ Mutual reviews unlock
```

## Database Models

```
User ─┬─ Client ─── Event ─── EventServiceRequirement ─┬─ Proposal
      │                                                  └─ Contract
      └─ Professional ─┬─ ProfessionalService
                       ├─ Skill / ProfessionalSkill
                       ├─ Experience
                       ├─ PortfolioItem
                       ├─ Proposal
                       └─ Contract

Contract ─┬─ Payment (INITIAL, FINAL)
           ├─ Deliverable (0 or 1, optional links only)
           ├─ Review (client→professional, professional→client)
           └─ Dispute ─── DisputeEvidence

Notification
```

No `ProfessionalApplication`, `AvailabilityRule`, `TimeOff`, `Revision`, or `AuditLog` models — professional intake is a status field on `Professional`, scheduling conflicts are checked directly against `Contract` rows, and delivery is a status + one optional record rather than a versioned revision flow.

## Key Business Rules

**Professional gating**
- Applying = creating the `Professional` record itself, `status = PENDING`.
- Only `status = APPROVED` unlocks professional-only actions (browsing events, proposing, contracting).
- Email verification required for both clients and professionals.

**Scheduling**
- Every `EventServiceRequirement` has its own `startAt`/`endAt` and budget, independent of the parent event's time range.
- `startAt < endAt` is enforced on every proposal, contract, and service.
- A professional cannot hold two `CONFIRMED`/`IN_PROGRESS` contracts whose time ranges overlap: `existing.startAt < new.endAt AND existing.endAt > new.startAt`. This check runs directly against the `Contract` table — there is no separate availability model.

**Hiring**
- One requirement → only one active hired professional at a time; other requirements on the same event fill independently.
- One professional → can hold multiple contracts for the same event provided their service periods don't overlap.
- `acceptingBookings = false` blocks new contracts but does not invalidate existing confirmed ones.
- Proposal acceptance and contract creation are wrapped in a database transaction to prevent race conditions.

**Delivery**
- Contract lifecycle: `PENDING → CONFIRMED → IN_PROGRESS → DELIVERED → COMPLETED` (plus `CANCELLED` / `DISPUTED` / `RESOLVED`).
- A `Deliverable` (title, description, array of external links) is optional and capped at one per contract.
- Marking `DELIVERED` never requires a `Deliverable` to exist — many services (decoration, makeup, live sound) have nothing to hand over.

**Payments**
- 30% paid upfront to reach `CONFIRMED`; 70% paid once the contract is `DELIVERED`, moving it to `COMPLETED`.
- Payment success is **always** verified server-side via bKash callback — the frontend result is never trusted.
- Final payment is blocked if a dispute is open on the contract.
- Only one payment per (contract, stage) is permitted.

**Reviews**
- Reviews unlock only once the contract is `COMPLETED`.
- One review per direction (Client→Professional, Professional→Client) per contract.

**Disputes**
- Either party may raise a dispute; at least one piece of evidence is required.
- Admin inspects all contract, payment, and evidence records before resolving.
